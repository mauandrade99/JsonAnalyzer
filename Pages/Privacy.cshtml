<p>Thank you for using JsonAnalyzer. Your privacy is critically important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your data when you use this application.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Our Core Privacy Principle: Your Data Stays Local</h3>

<p>
    The most important thing to know is that JsonAnalyzer is designed to run entirely on your local machine (localhost). When you upload a file or paste text into this tool, the data is processed between your web browser and the local server instance running on your own computer.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>At no point is your JSON data, or any part of its content, sent over the internet to our servers or any third-party service.</strong> It never leaves your machine.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>Information We Process</h3>

<p>To provide its functionality, the application processes the following types of information:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Uploaded JSON Files:</strong> You can select a JSON file from your local computer for analysis. The file is sent to the local server for stream processing and is immediately discarded after the analysis is complete. We do not save, store, or log the content of your files.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Pasted JSON Text:</strong> You can paste JSON text into the validator. This text is sent to the local server for syntax validation and is also discarded after the request is complete.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>How We Use Your Data</h3>

<p>The content of your JSON files and text is used exclusively for the following purposes and only for the duration of a single request:</p>
<ul>
    <li>To count the occurrences of specific properties and values as you requested.</li>
    <li>To validate the syntax of the JSON text you provide.</li>
    <li>To render an interactive tree view for client-side visualization.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    This processing is ephemeral. Once the results are displayed, the server retains no memory of your data.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>Cookie Usage</h3>

<p>
    This application uses standard cookies provided by the ASP.NET Core framework for essential functionality and security. These include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Antiforgery Cookie:</strong> A security cookie used to help protect the application from Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. It does not contain any personal information and does not track you.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>We do not use cookies for tracking, advertising, or analytics purposes.</p>
